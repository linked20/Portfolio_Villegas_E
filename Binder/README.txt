part 1

Upon opening result.7z with 7zip open archive it only displays the worm.bat file 
nothing else. When I run it without extracting an error message displays saying it
cannot find the file but it still executes the worm with every iterance showing the error message.
When attempting to open under the .gif extension the file is opened up in IE explorer
perfectly fine with no sign of the worm being used.
